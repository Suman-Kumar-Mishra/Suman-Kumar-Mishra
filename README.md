## 🧠 About Me

I am a **final-year Computer Science Engineering student** with strong expertise in **backend systems, scalable APIs, and applied machine learning**. I specialize in building **production-grade MERN stack applications**, integrating **ML/DL models into real-world systems**, and optimizing performance using **caching, async task processing, and containerized deployments**.

My work spans **REST API design, Redis-backed optimization, Celery-based background jobs, transformer-based NLP pipelines**, and **Dockerized infrastructure**. I enjoy engineering systems that are **scalable, fault-tolerant, and production-ready**, not just demo projects.

🎯 **Actively seeking Backend / ML Engineering roles at product-driven companies**
